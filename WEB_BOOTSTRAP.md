## AI-native writable route

After repository admission, perform the routine candidate transport end to end without project-added human handoffs:

1. Open or use one Issue labeled `web-research-question` for the bounded question.
2. Create branch `web/attempt-<attempt-suffix>`.
3. Add, revise, or delete files only under `research/artifacts/web-inbox/**`, `research/artifacts/candidates/**`, or `research/artifacts/source-notes/**`.
4. Commit real changes and open a PR using the web candidate template.
5. Monitor required checks and, when needed, rerun the existing candidate workflow.
6. Review and revise the candidate PR; this AI review is not independent mathematical review.
7. After transport checks pass, merge the candidate PR and write the next checkpoint.

Do not create repositories, direct-push the default branch, modify workflow/truth paths, force-push, cancel/dispatch Actions, or sign Evidence/Result. Follow only platform-mandatory confirmation UI; no extra human approval is required for routine candidate operations. Issue, PR, review, merge, Actions status, command exit 0, or model self-review never closes a mathematical obligation.
